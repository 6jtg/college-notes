# The 2 core unit exams
Ironically, the textbook for this course focuses heavily on the material for these two exams, highlighting almost nothing about the longer ESP or even longer Occupational Specialism - I've written more about this on the [textbook page](/textbook).

Paper 1 is titled "Digital Analysis, Legislation, and Emerging Issues" and Paper 2 "The Business Environment".

| Paper 1 (2hr 30min) | Paper 2 (2hr 30min) |
| :------------------ | :------------------ |
| 1. [Problem Solving](/spec/core-unit-1)  | 5. [Business Context](/spec/core-unit-5) |
| 2. [Introduction to Programming](/spec/core-unit-2) | 6. [Data](/spec/core-unit-6) |
| 3. [Emerging Issues and Impact of Digital](/spec/core-unit-3) | 7. [Digital Environments](/spec/core-unit-7) |
| 4. [Legislation and Regulatory Requirements](/spec/core-unit-4) | 8. [Security](/spec/core-unit-8) |

Each exam is 2 hours and 30 minutes long and are worth a combined total of 100 marks.
