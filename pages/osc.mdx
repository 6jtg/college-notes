# Occupational Specialist content

The spec on this is absolutely ginormous so I'm going to have all the details of different section in the dropdown, but this page will have details on the exam tasks which are to be completed in the 67 hours.

- [Task 1](#task-1-20-hours): Analysing the problem and designing a solution
- [Task 2](#task-2-30-hours): Developing a prototype design solution
- [Task 3a](#task-3a-15-hours): Gathering feedback to inform future developments
- [Task 3b](#task-3b-2-hours): Evaluating feedback to inform future developments

There is also a practice scenario created by Pearson which you can find [here](/osc/bean-and-brew).


## Task 1 (20 hours)

### Produce a detailed proposal for the digital solution required by the client
1. Your proposal should provide a rationale
2. The functional and non-functional requirements of the solution
3. A full list of the problems that need to be solved to meet all the requirements
4. The key performance indicators (KPI's) and user acceptance criteria for the proposed solution
5. A full description of the proposed solution

You should also justify how your solution meets the needs of the clients and users and how potential risks will be mitigated. You should also cover how relevant regulatory guidelines and legal requirements will be met.

### Produce a set of design documents for the digital solution that you are proposing
The design documentation must include:
- data requirements
- interface designs
- potential algorithmic solutions
- testing strategy

The design documentation should contain enough detail to:
- clearly allow the client to make an informed decision on the project
- be able to communicate the solution to technical and non-technical stakeholders
- allow an outside developer to use the documents to build the solution
- demonstrate the algorithm designs of most sections

The testing strategy does not need to cover all the tests required but should provide a selection of the required tests and an overview of the proposed solution. It should also show: the testing order and the required types of tests.


## Task 2 (30 hours)

### Develop a functional prototype of your digital solution
During the development you must:
- implement front-end and back-end processes using at least two coding languages
- create, find, and utilise appropriate graphics
- document the reiterative process
- document iterative testing
- produce the maintainable code
- develop a quality user experience
- make sure all regulatory and legal guidelines are followed

### Develop a log of what you have been doing
This log needs to contain:
- records of the solutions
- descriptions of the content and purpose
- records of the date you retrieved the information

### Create a testing plan and log
Your testing documentation does not need to detail all tests carried out but should demonstrate (using appropriate test data):
- an iterative approach to testing
- a full understanding of how to test
- inputs
- calculations
- validation
- processes


## Task 3a (15 hours)

### Produce a plan for how you intend to gather feedback
Your plan should include appropriate audiences and types of demonstrations that will need to be conducted in order to provide assurance to the client that the product will meet their requirements.

### Evaluate your prototype's functionality
(using your finished prototype and appropriate tools, methods and techniques prepare and carryout a series of demonstrations)

Your demonstrations must be for a technical audience (e.g. programming professionals), and a non-technical audience (e.g. the client, the users).

### Gather and record feedback in a suitable way that will allow it to be analysed


## Task 3b (2 hours)

This task is actually quite similar to [the last task of the ESP](/esp/task-4b) where you have to evaluate your work.

### Explain how your solution meets the clients requirements and KPI's
- how effective the content and assets are in meeting the needs of the client
- explain the reliability and validity of the sources of information you used that were not created by you
- analyse and describe any legal and ethical implications of the assets and content selected

### Talk through the design solution and recommend ways it could be further developed
Your presentation should contain ways to prevent and identify foreseeable issues such as:
- changes to the regulatory requirements
- changes in business processes
- compatibility with new technology
