## Qualification Structure
The T Level has 2 mandatory components:

#### Core Component
"This component covers the underpinning knowledge, concepts and skills that support
threshold competence in the digital industry. It has 600 GLH and is assessed by two
externally set Core examinations and an Employer Set Project."

#### Occupational Specialist Component
"There is a single Occupational Specialist Component in this Technical Qualification,
which is 600 GLH. Therefore, students undertaking the T Level Technical Qualification
in Digital Production, Design and Development will choose this specialism.
This component covers the occupational specialist knowledge and skills required to
demonstrate threshold competence for the specialism and it will be assessed by a
skills-related project that synoptically assesses the Performance Outcome skills and
associated underpinning knowledge."

```
GLH stands for "Guided Learning Hours" and TQT stands for "Total Qualification Time".

### Core Component
You can read the absolute specifics on [this units page](/core-units/unit-1) and [the esp page](/esp) but in summary, the core component consists of 2 sets of exams.

#### 1. Two core exams
Ironically, the textbook for this course literally only includes material for these two exams, highlighting almost nothing about the longer ESP or even longer Occupational Specialism - I've written more about this on the [textbook page](/textbook).

Paper 1 is titled "Digital Analysis, Legislation, and Emerging Issues" and Paper 2 "The Business Environment".
