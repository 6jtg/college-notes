## Qualification Structure
The T Level has 2 mandatory components:

#### Core Component
"This component covers the underpinning knowledge, concepts and skills that support
threshold competence in the digital industry. It has 600 GLH and is assessed by two
externally set Core examinations and an Employer Set Project."

#### Occupational Specialist Component
"There is a single Occupational Specialist Component in this Technical Qualification,
which is 600 GLH. Therefore, students undertaking the T Level Technical Qualification
in Digital Production, Design and Development will choose this specialism.
This component covers the occupational specialist knowledge and skills required to
demonstrate threshold competence for the specialism and it will be assessed by a
skills-related project that synoptically assesses the Performance Outcome skills and
associated underpinning knowledge."

```
GLH stands for "Guided Learning Hours" and TQT stands for "Total Qualification Time".

### Core Component
You can read the absolute specifics on [this units page](/core-units/unit-1) and [the esp page](/esp/task-1) but in summary, the core component consists of 2 different **sets** of exams.

#### 1. Two core exams
Ironically, the textbook for this course focuses heavily on the material for these two exams, highlighting almost nothing about the longer ESP or even longer Occupational Specialism - I've written more about this on the [textbook page](/textbook).

Paper 1 is titled "Digital Analysis, Legislation, and Emerging Issues" and Paper 2 "The Business Environment".

| Paper 1 (2hr 30min) | Paper 2 (2hr 30min) |
| :------------------ | :------------------ |
| 1. Problem Solving  | 5. Business Context |
| 2. Introduction to Programming | 6. Data |
| 3. Emerging Issues and Impact of Digital | 7. Digital Environments |
| 4. Legislation and Regulatory Requirements | 8. Security |

Each exam is 2 hours and 30 minutes long and are worth a combined total of 100 marks.

You can read more about this section on the [core unit pages](/core-units/unit-1).

#### 2. The "Employer Set Project"
Beginning with a (roughly) one week long "familiarisation period", pre-release information is given to colleges and students so that you can begin to research the industry sector of the business you have been given. For example, my ESP was about a restaurant called "Gurreb's BBQ". The week you're given to do this in is very different to an actual exam as to carry out research you will be able to access the internet, work in groups, and make notes about your research (you of course are not able to bring these notes into the actual exam though).

| Task Number | Focus | Length | Marks |
| :---------- | :---- | :----- | :---- |
| 1           | Planning a project | 3hrs | 19 |
| 2           | Identifying and fixing defects in existing code | 3hrs | 21 |
| 3           | Designing a solution | 3hrs | 17 |
| 4a          | Developing a solution | 4hrs | 34 |
| 4b          | Reflective evaluation | 1hr 30min | 9 |

You can read more about this section on the [ESP pages](/esp/task-1).

### Occupational Specialist Component
I have little to no detail on how this works so I'll be editing it later. All I really know is it's 67 hours long.

---

### Work Experience
I've added more details about the work experience to [this page](/work-experience) as it's not actually part of the course spec but since you need work experience to pass the course it is still very important.
