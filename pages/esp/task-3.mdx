# Task 3 - Designing a solution

### Decomposition of the problem
1. Break down the problem into smaller parts suitable for computational relations, justifying any decisions made. Make effective use of detailed abstraction and refinement.
2. Use elements of reusable components,
3. Use good decomposition to show all the necessary subsystems that make up the main solution.
4. Visualise the decomposition.
5. Use appropriate tools for communicating algorithms (e.g. flowcharts, pseudocode, data flow diagrams).

### Application of logical thinking
1. Describe the parts of the solution using algorithms, justifying how these algorithms form a complete solution to the problem.
2. Clearly define the steps.
3. Uniquely define each step. They should depend on the input and the result of the preceding steps.
4. Ensure the algorithm makes use of key constructs (e.g. sequence, selection and iteration).

### Use of conventions
1. Demonstrate correct use of structure and convention for the chosen method of communication, such as correct use of symbols for flowcharts and key words used in pseudocode.
2. Select and make consistent use of appropriate naming conventions throughout.

### Communication of the design
1. Ensure design documents are of sufficient detail to:
  - effectively communicate the intended solution
  - allow the client to make informed decisions
  - allow a third party to use design documents to create the proposed solution
2. Communicate intended solution effectively and clearly, with use of:
  - appropriate combination of written and diagrammatical presentation
  - appropriate use of technical vocabulary
  - consideration of audience
  - explanations of structures and process in the design
