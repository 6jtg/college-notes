# Task 2 - Identifying and fixing defects in an existing code

### Use of testing to identify defects
1. Assess the given code against requirements.
2. Carry out testing to identify issues in given code.
3. Perform any remedial actions required, justifying any decision made when fixing the defect.

### Documenting the testing process
Provide annotated evidence of testing, include:
- identifying tests to be carried out
- describing the purpose of the identified test
- identifying test data to be used (valid, valid extreme, invalid, invalid extreme, erroneous)
- describing the expected results
- describing the actual results of the tests performed
- comparing the actual results to the expected results
- describing any further actions that are required
- refining the system as required

### The solution
1. Correct errors in code add and/or remove code to ensure that the given code is functional and meets the given requirements.
2. Follow appropriate programming conventions when fixing the code to ensure that it makes use of precise logic and programming structures throughout, so that the program produces consistently correct outcomes.
