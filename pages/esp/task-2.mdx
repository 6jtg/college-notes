# Task 2 - Identifying and fixing defects in an existing code

The focus of Task 2 is to identify and fix defects in existing code. At the start of the exam you are given a brief aswell as other material needed like the Non-working code inside of a .txt file (usually on a USB stick). For this task, you need to test and fix the code you're given which relates to the business in question. You're also given a test-logging template on this USB too for you to describe any errors you find and how you fixed them.

The two main requirements for this task are:
| Requirements | Marks | "Competencies covered" |
| :----------- | :---- | :--------------------- |
| using testing to identify defects with the non-working code and documenting the testing process including any possible remedial actions to be taken | 12 | E1, E2, M10, D3 |
| producing a working solution based on the results of your testing | 9 | M4, M5, M7 |

Just like Task 1, there are 3 hours allocated to Task 2 which the textbook recommends you split in half to work on each requirement.

## Use of testing to identify defects, and documenting the testing process
After reading through the brief, you will need to analyse the non-working code and create a test plan to identify the issues that are stopping the code from working properly.

When you are testing to identify defects you will need to:
- assess the given code against requirements
- carry out testing to identify issues in the given code
- perform any remedial actions required, justifying any decision made when fixing the defect

The test plan you create, use and amend should cover:
- identify the tests to be carried out
- describe the purpose of the identified test
- identify the test data to be used including valid, valid extreme, invalid, invalid extreme, and erroneous
- describe the expected results
- describe the actual results of the tests performed
- compare the actual results of testing with the actual results
- describe any further actions that are required

"At this stage it is important that you also test the code to make sure it is robust and performs as required. One way of doing this is to do a dry run with values that should produce an error message and that this error message only appears when incorrect values have been input."

On the page "[ESP Exam June 2023](/esp/june-2023)" I have linked a good template for logging tests you do and how you fixed them.

## The solution
After this, you will need to make the changes to the code and confirm the changes you have made make the code work as intended.

Aswell as looking for errors that break the code/stop you from continuing, you should also look for formatting errors like indentation errors. Other examples could be:
- if the code requires a date output, checks should be made that the defined format is that of the UK date format - dd/mm/yyyy
- any currency outputs are in £ with 2 decimal places (like £12.99)
