# ESP Exam June 2023

I'm not actually sure if I'm meant to make this public but it is actually really helpful so I'm going to do it anyway.

This is a collection of everything used in the ESP exam from June 2023, including task briefs, the entire pre-release, and other resources given to students. I will put a full directory below.

This exam was based on a business called "Gurreb's BBQ", a restaurant looking for "a new centralised digital solution" to manage it's inventory and support business operations. Gurrebâ€™s BBQ is a small chain of restaurants with five venues across two major UK cities.
