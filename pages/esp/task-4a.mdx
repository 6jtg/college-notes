# Task 4a - Developing a solution

### The solution
Apply an understanding of programming to develop a solution that meets the requirements of a brief, including:
  - refining the system as required
  - demonstrating an appropriate level of technical skill, and understanding of programming techniques and problem solving
  - use of pre-written and user-written modules with appropriate interface
  - discussion of any issues that may have come about from the testing

### Code organisation
Ensure code produced for the solution is appropriate to meet the demands of the brief, including:
  - trying to avoid multiple pages of nested if-clauses and for-loops with a lot of copy-pasted procedural code
  - clear and meaningful indentation
  - pieces of logic, classes or objects, with proper structure
  - comments whenever possible to help explain the logic
  - good use of local variables and minimal use of global variables
  - use of constants
  - well-designed interface
  - consistent style throughout
  - defensive programming
  - good exception handling

### User experience
Meet user needs, with consideration of:
  - consistency of the product
  - accessibility to all types of users
  - user interface design (visual design in line with brand goals)
  - meaningful feedback, changes made and problems overcome

### Responsiveness to the brief
1. Formal documentation of testing is not required in this activity.
2. Testing by the student should still be carried out but its use should be implicit through:
  - a working product
  - a product that meets the requirements detailed in the given task brief
