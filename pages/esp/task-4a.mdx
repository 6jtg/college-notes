# Task 4a - Developing a solution

Task 4a will require you to develop a solution. The requirements of the additional functionality to the solution you designed and manipulated in [Task 3](/esp/task-3) will be given to you. The brief for this exam will also typically provide you with extra system and user requirements. Whilst coding it is worth checking back to these requirements to make sure that you have not deviated away from them. According to the textbook, you will usually be provided with a data file which can be used to test your solution.

Unlike the first three exams, this one is 4 hours long.

| Requirements | Marks | "Competencies covered" |
| :----------- | :---- | :--------------------- |
| Functionality | 6 | |
| Logic and programming structures | 3 | |
| Robustness | 3 | |
| Security | 6 | |
| Code organisation | 8 | M10 |
| User experience | 8 | E6 |

When creating your coded solution, you must:
- consider the security requirements and use secure coding principles and practices to mitigate against potential threats and vulnerabilities
- ensure your code is maintainable, readable and functional, and follows accepted programming conventions

During the exam, you will not be required to produce formal evidence that you've tested your code unlike in Task 2. However to ensure that the code meets the specified system and user requirements you should probably test the code as you write it.

Your final code must:
- be well-structured including the use of modules with a defined structure (for example, the use of procedures, funtions, or classes)
- have clear annotation to enable future maintenance
- use sensible and appropriate naming of all variables and structures

Your code should also meet the defined user requirements. This could be demonstrated by the inclusion of:
- user input handling (like the use of validation)
- user guidance and error messages
- outputs that meet the specified requirements, the user's needs and that are fit for purpose
