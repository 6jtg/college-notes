# 1. Be able to analyse a problem to define requirements and acceptance criteria aligned to user needs

### 1.1 Understand the stages of the software development life cycle and be able to apply them to digital projects

##### Life cycle stage: Research and familiarisation
- Explore and understand the initial client request/project brief.
- Carry out research relating to the specific context and market environment.
- Identify shortfalls in own skills and knowledge and plan learning opportunities to make up for these shortfalls.

##### Life cycle stage: Planning and requirement analysis
- Identify business requirements such as new software and amending/increasing security.
- Assess the measurable value of the proposed solution in relation to the user and client/business.
- Apply computational thinking (decomposition, pattern recognition and abstraction) to split the problem into discrete objects.
- Define the functional and non-functional requirements of the solution.
- Define the key performance indicators (KPIs) of the solution.
- Identify the performance constraints in digital projects.
- Create user acceptance criteria.
- Schedule projects (tasks, subtasks, milestones).
- Allocate appropriate resources to digital projects.
- Estimate costs of digital projects.
- Choose programming language(s) for digital projects based on key criteria.

##### Life cycle stage: Performing a user analysis
- Select and use business analysis models to aid problem solving, *including user stories, activity diagrams, mind maps, product road maps, process diagrams, and entity relationship diagrams.*

##### Life cycle stage: Designing the product
- Create interface designs.
- Plan how to solve key problems (design algorithms).
- Create data requirement designs.
- Create a proof of concept.
- Produce initial testing schedule.

##### Life cycle stage: Developing and testing the product
- Create a prototype.
- Plan and implement appropriate testing.

##### Life cycle stage: Deploying/implementing the product
- Install and configure the product.
- Update the product.

##### Life cycle stage: Maintenance
- Provide system support.
- Provide user support.
- Carry out bug fixing.
- Arrange/carry out user training.
- Release updates to enhance the product.
- Understand the value to the organisation of the digital product and the role the software development life cycle plays.


### 1.2 Understand the roles and responsibilities of the digital team within the software development life cycle

##### Product owner/client
Sets and communicates the requirements of the product.

##### Scrum master
Facilitates the team to maintain team cohesions, ensuring the team has access to resources they require.

##### Technical lead
Provides the technical guidance and support for the project team.

##### Project manager
Plans, organises, and manages (budget, scope, schedule, risk and quality) on all phases of a project.

##### Software development team

###### Systems analysist
Analyses the current system and provides the requirements for the new system; uses the requirements to design the new software solution.

###### UX/UI designer
Interviews users, researches market data and gathers findings to design the user interface.

###### Software developer/engineer
Uses the designs to create and maintain a working solution that is usable, secure and stable.

###### Operations engineer
Ensures the stability of the product.

###### Security engineer
Ensures the security of the product.

###### Software testers
Responsible for the quality assurance of the software and development.


### 1.3 Understand the key features of, and be able to select, appropriate project methodologies when developing a software solution

###### Key features of agile
- Incremental delivery model (sprint, epic, story, spikes).
- Emphasis on producing high-quality products, with initially limited functionality.
- Each increment delivers additional functionality.
- Requirements can be continually altered throughout the project.
- Can lack formal documentation.
- Users/clients see working products at each iteration.
- Cost-effective method to get an initial product to market.
- Cancelled/partially completed projects will still result in some usable code/product(s).

###### Key features of Scaled Agile
- Expanded incremental delivery model (same as before but with "product increments").
- Emphasis on producing high-quality products with initially limited functionality.
- Each increment delivers additional functionality.
- Requirements can be continually altered throughout the project.
- Provides cohesive reporting.
- Users/clients see working products at each iteration.
- Cost-effective method to get an initial product to market.
- Cancelled/partially completed projects will still result in some usable code/product(s).
- Final iteration focuses on stability.

###### Key features of Waterfall
- Rigidly structured with systematic steps.
- Progress measured through the number of artefacts completed.
- High initial costs with slower return on investment.
- Products cancelled during early stages may result in no usable code/product(s).
- Limited user/client interaction.
- High importance placed on documentation.

###### Key features of Rapid Application Development (RAD)
- Focus on quick creation of prototypes, which are systematically improved.
- Emphasis on developing all features first and quality second.
- Users/clients may see only partially working products or mock-ups during early iterations.
- Relies heavily on reuse of previously developed code.
- Suitable for small- to medium-scale projects.

###### Key features of LEAN
- Emphasis on reducing "waste" in software and projects *such as repeated tasks or unnecessary change.*
- Decisions are made last minute to reduce chance of waste.
- Short iteration cycles with fast delivery of working versions.
- Emphasis is placed on producing iterations that are fit for use, and not specifically in delivering all features or requirements.
- Suitable for projects with small teams and when resources are limited.
- Understand features and approaches of user-centred design (UCD) and how it is used within a software development life cycle.


### 1.4 Understand and define the functional and non-functional requirements of a software solution
- Understand the concept of ‘secure by design’ and how this influences the decisions made regarding functional and non-functional requirements.
- Understand and define functional requirements of a software solution.
- Understand and define non-functional requirements of a software solution.
- Understand the use of ‘spike testing’ as an early product-testing method to establish requirements and determine the extent of the problem and the required scope of a software solution.

### 1.5 Investigate the current and potential uses of emerging technologies and how they impact on industries
Investigate the impact on software development of emerging technologies such as:
- Operational Technology (OT)
- Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Virtual Intelligence (VI)
- Conversational AI
- the Internet of Things (IoT)
- Machine Learning
- Object recognition
- Biometrics
- Computer vision
- Robotics
- Cloud services and platforms
- Blockchain
- Data lakes and data warehousing
- Drones
- 3D printing
- 5G networks

### 1.6 Identify and be able to address personal training needs that can boost job performance during the software development process
- Ensure the software developer is able to complete the required solution.
- Use different methods to address the personal training needs required to enable completion of the project.
