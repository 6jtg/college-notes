## [Task 1 - Planning a Project](/esp/task-1)

```
Be able to use project planning tools to apply understanding of project planning in response to a scenario.
```

### Gantt Chart
1. Assess the strengths of people and assign appropriate tasks to them.
2. Make scheduling decisions in response to a defined deadline.
3. Prioritise activities or tasks based on analysis of requirements.
4. Demonstrate how to correctly and appropriately assign resources to project tasks.
5. Produce a Gantt chart to show project tasks and organise them efficiently, using an appropriate Software Development Lifecycle model.

### Resource and Cost Plan
1. Identify and calculate costs of a project, including: materials, physical resources, and personnel.
2. Select and allocate resources to the resource list, and correctly attribute costs to provide an accurate estimate of the total project cost.

### Rationale
1. Consider the factors that are most relevant when planning projects.
2. Justify project planning decisions made, with consideration given to:
  - cost, risk, and benefits to identified stakeholders
  - order and timing of tasks
  - selection and allocation of resources, including personnel and physical resources
  - dependencies and prerequisites

## [Task 2 - Identifying and fixing defects in an existing code](/esp/task-2)

### Use of testing to identify defects
1. Assess the given code against requirements.
2. Carry out testing to identify issues in given code.
3. Perform any remedial actions required, justifying any decision made when fixing the defect.

### Documenting the testing process
Provide annotated evidence of testing, include:
- identifying tests to be carried out
- describing the purpose of the identified test
- identifying test data to be used (valid, valid extreme, invalid, invalid extreme, erroneous)
- describing the expected results
- describing the actual results of the tests performed
- comparing the actual results to the expected results
- describing any further actions that are required
- refining the system as required

### The solution
1. Correct errors in code add and/or remove code to ensure that the given code is functional and meets the given requirements.
2. Follow appropriate programming conventions when fixing the code to ensure that it makes use of precise logic and programming structures throughout, so that the program produces consistently correct outcomes.

---

## [Task 3 - Designing a solution](/esp/task-3)

### Decomposition of the problem
1. Break down the problem into smaller parts suitable for computational relations, justifying any decisions made. Make effective use of detailed abstraction and refinement.
2. Use elements of reusable components,
3. Use good decomposition to show all the necessary subsystems that make up the main solution.
4. Visualise the decomposition.
5. Use appropriate tools for communicating algorithms (e.g. flowcharts, pseudocode, data flow diagrams).

### Application of logical thinking
1. Describe the parts of the solution using algorithms, justifying how these algorithms form a complete solution to the problem.
2. Clearly define the steps.
3. Uniquely define each step. They should depend on the input and the result of the preceding steps.
4. Ensure the algorithm makes use of key constructs (e.g. sequence, selection and iteration).

### Use of conventions
1. Demonstrate correct use of structure and convention for the chosen method of communication, such as correct use of symbols for flowcharts and key words used in pseudocode.
2. Select and make consistent use of appropriate naming conventions throughout.

### Communication of the design
1. Ensure design documents are of sufficient detail to:
  - effectively communicate the intended solution
  - allow the client to make informed decisions
  - allow a third party to use design documents to create the proposed solution
2. Communicate intended solution effectively and clearly, with use of:
  - appropriate combination of written and diagrammatical presentation
  - appropriate use of technical vocabulary
  - consideration of audience
  - explanations of structures and process in the design

## [Task 4a - Developing a solution](/esp/task-4a)

### The solution
Apply an understanding of programming to develop a solution that meets the requirements of a brief, including:
  - refining the system as required
  - demonstrating an appropriate level of technical skill, and understanding of programming techniques and problem solving
  - use of pre-written and user-written modules with appropriate interface
  - discussion of any issues that may have come about from the testing

### Code organisation
Ensure code produced for the solution is appropriate to meet the demands of the brief, including:
  - trying to avoid multiple pages of nested if-clauses and for-loops with a lot of copy-pasted procedural code
  - clear and meaningful indentation
  - pieces of logic, classes or objects, with proper structure
  - comments whenever possible to help explain the logic
  - good use of local variables and minimal use of global variables
  - use of constants
  - well-designed interface
  - consistent style throughout
  - defensive programming
  - good exception handling

### User experience
Meet user needs, with consideration of:
  - consistency of the product
  - accessibility to all types of users
  - user interface design (visual design in line with brand goals)
  - meaningful feedback, changes made and problems overcome

### Responsiveness to the brief
1. Formal documentation of testing is not required in this activity.
2. Testing by the student should still be carried out but its use should be implicit through:
  - a working product
  - a product that meets the requirements detailed in the given task brief

## [Task 4b - Reflective evaluation](/esp/task-4b)

### Programming outcomes
1. Be able to apply reflection and evaluation techniques.
2. Provide evidence that the product meets brief requirements:
  - include measures against success criteria
  - provide evidence that the product meets user needs from testing
  - discuss how it could be improved if the problem was revisited and given detailed consideration

### Comparison to designs
  - Provide a well-developed line of reasoning which is clear and logically structured. The information presented is relevant and substantiated.
  - Discuss the maintainability of the solution.
  - Discuss potential further developments of the solution.
  - Discuss any changes and why they are different from the original designs.
