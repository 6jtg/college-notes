# Work Experience

One of the most important and attractive parts of this course is the mandatory work experience. I say "attractive" because personally it is the only reason I chose this course in the first place.

To even be able to pass this course you need to complete 315 hours (roughly 45 days) worth of work experience in the industry. If you don't get this work experience, your course supposedly voids.
