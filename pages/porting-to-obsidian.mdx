# Porting to Obsidian

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is a completely markdown based note-taking app that allows you to create "vaults" of notes typed using Markdown. I use it as my personal note-taking app aswell as Google keep.

By downloading the "pages" subfolder of this website from [Github](https://github.com/6jtg/college-notes), you can import all the pages from this website into the app as they were written using MDX - an extended form of markdown.


### Using .mdx files in Obsidian
Because Obsidian runs off the normal .md files, you have to find a workaround to be able to use .mdx files in the app. The easiest workaround is this "mdx as md" plugin from [mkozhukharenko on Github](https://github.com/mkozhukharenko/mdx-as-md-obsidian). You can easily install it from the "Community plugins" section of the Obsidian app's settings by searching for "mdx" and enabling it from there. Community plugins don't actually remain installed between vaults so if you are opening this project in a different vault you will need to install and enable it again.
